This is the **Vanilla CSS** version of the Sprint 1 layout challenge for ITACADEMY.  
The layout has been built using only **HTML and plain CSS**, with no frameworks or preprocessors.

---

## 🧠 Goal

Replicate a design using just native HTML5 and CSS3, with a focus on:

- Semantic HTML structure
- Clean, reusable CSS
- Responsive design via media queries
- Good practices without utility classes or nesting
