# ðŸŽ¨ Sprint 1 - Design to Development - ITACADEMY

> ðŸš§ **WARNING: This project is still in progress and not yet complete.**  
> Some features, styles, or sections may be missing or unfinished.

This project is a **design replication exercise** to practice styling with different approaches.

The same design is implemented three times using:

1. **Vanilla CSS**
2. **SASS**
3. **Tailwind CSS**

---

## ðŸ§© Project Structure

The project is organized into **separate Git branches**, each containing a different version of the same layout:

- `Vanilla-CSS`: the base implementation using plain CSS
- `SASS-Refactor`: the same layout refactored with SASS
- `Tailwind-Refactor-v2`: the final version using Tailwind CSS

Each branch is **independent**, so you can switch between them and see how the same layout is built using different technologies.
